A real-time multi-camera system that detects people in a queue (YOLOv8), tracks them across frames (Deep SORT), and maintains stable global identities (OSNet-based ReID). It fuses streams from two cameras into a unified view, displays per-person bounding boxes with confidence scores and global IDs, and reports the live queue length.

reid_osnet.pt : fine tuned reid with osnet with the persons in the video.
